# Project
CareHouse is a website made using vanilla JavaScript, which implements the flow of a house furniture shopping cart.
It uses local storage to salve the users items in the cart.
* **CONTENTFUL**\
During my studies, I used contentful and had my first time implementing Content Delivery API (CDA) in a project in order to make it simpler the website management.
* **NETLIFY**\
I also learned how to free hoste the project in netlify.
